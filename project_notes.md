## Database Optimization (Phase 2, Completed March 11, 2024)
1. Database Optimizer Implementation:
   - Created `DatabaseOptimizer` class (`app/database/DatabaseOptimizer.php`)
   - Implemented singleton pattern for global access
   - Added query caching with configurable TTL
   - Implemented connection pooling to reduce overhead
   - Added slow query logging for performance analysis
   - Integrated with the base Model class

2. Database Audit System:
   - Created `DatabaseAudit` class (`app/database/DatabaseAudit.php`)
   - Analyzes database structure for optimization opportunities
   - Identifies missing indexes, inefficient column types, and redundant tables
   - Generates SQL statements for implementing optimizations
   - Audit results saved to JSON files in the `logs` directory

3. Model Class Updates:
   - Updated to use the DatabaseOptimizer for all database operations
   - Added automatic connection pooling
   - Implemented query caching for read operations
   - Added cache invalidation for write operations
   - Improved parameter binding for better security

4. Testing Scripts:
   - `database/run_audit.php` - Run database structure audit
   - `database/connection_pool.php` - Test connection pooling
   - `database/query_cache.php` - Test query caching
   - `database/optimize_queries.php` - Analyze and optimize queries

5. Recommendations:
   - Consider consolidating product-specific tables into a single `products` table
   - Add indexes to foreign key columns and frequently queried fields
   - Optimize column types for better performance
   - Use specific column names instead of `SELECT *` in queries

6. Documentation:
   - `database/README.md` - Usage instructions and implementation details
   - `database/SUMMARY.md` - Summary of completed work and next steps

## Security Implementation (Phase 3)
1. Authentication System:
   - User authentication with email/password
   - Role-based authorization (admin, user)
   - Permission-based access control
   - Secure session handling
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

2. Security Features:
   - Input validation framework (`Security::validateInput()`)
   - Output escaping for XSS prevention (`Security::sanitizeInput()`)
   - CSRF protection (`Security::generateCsrfToken()`, `Security::validateCsrfToken()`)
   - Security headers (XSS Protection, Content Security Policy, etc.)

3. Middleware System:
   - Authentication middleware
   - CSRF middleware
   - Role-based authorization middleware
   - Permission-based authorization middleware
   - Security headers middleware

4. Database Tables:
   - `users` - User accounts with roles
   - `permissions` - Available permissions
   - `user_permissions` - User-permission relationships
   - Default admin user: admin@example.com / password

5. Authentication Views:
   - Login form: `/login`
   - Registration form: `/register`
   - Custom CSS for auth pages: `/assets/css/auth.css`

6. Usage Examples:
   ```php
   // Validate input
   $rules = [
       'email' => ['required' => true, 'type' => 'email'],
       'password' => ['required' => true, 'minLength' => 8]
   ];
   $errors = Security::validateInput($_POST, $rules);
   
   // Protect against CSRF
   // In form:
   <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo Security::generateCsrfToken(); ?>">
   // In controller:
   if (!Security::validateCsrfToken($_POST['csrf_token'])) {
       // Invalid token
   }
   
   // Check authentication
   if (Auth::check()) {
       // User is logged in
   }
   
   // Check roles
   if (Auth::hasRole('admin')) {
       // User is an admin
   }
   
   // Check permissions
   if (Auth::hasPermission('edit_products')) {
       // User can edit products
   }
   ```

7. Setup Instructions:
   - Run the database setup script: `php database/setup_auth.php`
   - This will create the necessary tables and default admin user
   - Default login: admin@example.com / password

## Server-Side Optimization (Phase 5, 1, Completed March 15, 2024)

   - Optimized memory and execution settings
   - Configured error handling and logging
   - Optimized session settings
   - Implemented realpath cache optimization

4. Request/Response Compression:

   - Implemented performance monitoring

6. Usage Examples:
   ```php
   // Cache data
   cacheData('my_key', $data, 300); // Cache for 5 minutes
   
   // Get cached data
   $data = getCachedData('my_key');
   
   // Cache a page
   $cachedPage = pageCache('/my-page', 300);
   if ($cachedPage === false) {
       // Page not cached, generate content
       // ...
       
       // Save page to cache
       savePageCache('/my-page', 300);
   }
   ```

## Image Path Handling (IMPORTANT)
1. Directory Structure:
   - The website uses an MVC architecture with a `public` directory as the web root
   - All publicly accessible files must be in the `public` directory
   - Images are stored in `public/assets/images/`

2. Image Path Fix (March 10, 2024):
   - Images were previously stored in `website/assets/images/` (outside public directory)
   - This caused images not to display on the website
   - Solution: All images were copied to `public/assets/images/` to make them web-accessible
   - The views handle various image path formats:
     - Paths starting with `assets/images/`
     - Paths with `../` prefixes
     - Simple filenames

3. Database Image Paths:
   - Image paths in the database are stored in various formats:
     - Some as `../../assets/images/filename.png`
     - Some as just filenames
   - The views handle these different formats automatically
   - When adding new images, place them in `public/assets/images/`

4. Image Path Handling in Views:
   - Views use a standardized approach to handle image paths
   - Path normalization code is included in all product-related views
   - Fallback images are provided for missing images

## Frontend Performance (Phase 5, 2, Completed March 16, 2024)
1. Routing System Fix:
   - Fixed 404 errors when clicking on categories and products
   - Updated Router.php to handle dynamic parameters in routes
   - Added redirects in .htaccess for old URL structure
   - Updated links in index.php to point to new MVC routes
   - Created test script to verify routing functionality
   - Ensured backward compatibility with old URLs

2. Browser Caching Implementation:
   - Enhanced .htaccess with cache control headers
   - Implemented browser caching for static assets
   - Set appropriate cache durations for different file types
   - Added cache control headers for HTML and PHP files
   - Implemented ETags for cache validation
   - Added Vary headers for proper cache handling

3. Critical Rendering Path Optimization:
   - Moved CSS to the head section
   - Deferred non-critical JavaScript
   - Inlined critical CSS for above-the-fold content
   - Reduced render-blocking resources
   - Implemented async loading for non-critical resources
   - Optimized font loading

4. Server Response Time Reduction:
   - Implemented database query caching
   - Added page caching for frequently accessed pages
   - Optimized PHP configuration
   - Reduced unnecessary database queries

   - Reduced third-party requests

6. Testing and Documentation:

   - Updated enhancement_tracker.md to reflect progress
   - Added detailed documentation in project_notes.md
   - Created route_test_results.html with test results
   - Updated .htaccess with comments explaining redirects

   - Check database name is correct
   - Ensure proper credentials in config

2. If autoloading fails:
   - Run `composer dump-autoload`
   - Check namespace declarations
   - Verify class file locations

3. If authentication doesn't work:
   - Ensure session is started
   - Check if auth tables are created
   - Verify user exists in database

4. If images don't display:
   - Ensure images are in `public/assets/images/`
   - Check image path handling in views
   - Verify image filenames match database records

5. If database optimization features don't work:
   - Ensure the DatabaseOptimizer class is properly autoloaded
   - Check that the logs directory exists and is writable
   - Verify database connection parameters in config/database.php

6. If server-side optimization features don't work:
   - Ensure the ServerOptimizer and PhpOptimizer classes are properly autoloaded
   - Check that the logs/cache directory exists and is writable
   - Verify PHP has the OpCache extension installed
   - Check Apache has the mod_deflate and mod_expires modules enabled
